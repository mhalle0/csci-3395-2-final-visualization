# Steam Data Visualization
#### Data Visualization - Final Project - Fall 2020
Using a sample of 200,000 interactions with the video game digital distribution service Steam, we created a D3 visualization showing the popularity of 5,153 different games by copies purchased, average time spent playing, and total time played. Although this isn't a complete list of activities on Steam, the sample size is large enough to provide a solid overview of what was happening on the platform in 2016.<br><br>
